# RentReady

RentReady is a React Native application built with Expo to help landlords manage their rental properties.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/client) installed on your iOS or Android device.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This command starts the Expo development server.

3.  **Open on Device/Emulator**
    -   **Physical Device:** Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal with the Expo Go app (Android) or Camera app (iOS).
    -   **Android Emulator:** Press `a` in the terminal (requires Android Studio & Emulator setup).
    -   **iOS Simulator:** Press `i` in the terminal (requires Xcode on macOS).
    -   **Web:** Press `w` in the terminal.

## Project Structure

-   `App.js` / `App.tsx`: Main entry point.
-   `src/`: Source code directory.
-   `__tests__/`: Unit tests.

## Troubleshooting

-   **"No Android connected device found"**: Make sure your Android emulator is running via Android Studio or your physical device is connected with USB Debugging enabled.
